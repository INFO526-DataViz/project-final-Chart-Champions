# Background

## High-level Goal

Develop a Shiny app that generates constellation maps that utilizes interactive elements, incorporating computational and visualization techniques.

## Goals & Motivations

-   Increasing engagement by personalizing the experience through various elements: color usage, map location, time zone, latitude/longitude location

-   Aiming to increase inclusivity for people of all backgrounds and levels of astronomical knowledge by designing with a user-friendly interface to ensure accessibility

-   Providing annotations to provide readability and educational context for a wide range of users, including astronomy beginners

## Dataset

-   The datasets are available in GeoJSON (`*.geojson`) and GeoPackage (`*.gpkg`) formats

-   Represents celestial objects' positions as of the J2000 epoch

-   Data used:

    -   `mw` = Milky Way dataset

    -   `constellations.lines` = Constellation Lines dataset

    -   `stars.8` = Stars dataset

## Analysis Approach

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Develop a Shiny app for personalized constellation maps with user input
-   Enhance user engagement in stargazing from various locations time zones and even user bases
-   Prioritize accessibility through a user-friendly interface and colorblind-friendly design
-   Provide contextual annotations for users with different levels of astronomical knowledge

```{r, warning=FALSE, fig.width=5.5}
penguins |>
  ggplot(aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = species, color = species)) +
  geom_boxplot(linewidth = 0.75,
               outlier.size = 2.5) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 15) +
  theme(legend.key.size = unit(0.8, "cm"))
```

# Results

## Conclusion {.column width="50%"}

-   Constellations aid in locating stars, galaxies, and other celestial bodies, offering reference points for astronomical observation and research.
-   Observations of constellations contribute to scientific discoveries, aiding in the understanding of star formation, stellar evolution, and the dynamics of galaxies.
-   Constellations serve as educational tools, engaging learners of all ages in the study of astronomy and offer an accessible entry point for teaching basic astronomical concepts.

If you want to generate a table, make sure it is in the HTML format (instead of Markdown or other formats), e.g.,

```{r}
penguins |> 
  head() |>
  kableExtra::kable() |>
  kableExtra::kable_styling()
```

## Limitations

-   Starmap app doesn't display any data like names and information about the constellations.

-   Some starmap apps can become complex due to the abundance use of features, making the interface crowded, confusing the new users.

-   Sometimes due to incomplete or inaccurate data, might lead to misidentification of celestial objects or missing information about certain stars or constellations.
