    "text": "Goal & Motivation\nThe primary objective of this project is to develop a Shiny app that not only generates interactive constellation maps but also prioritizes accessibility and personalization of these maps. By offering users the ability to input specific geographic locations, the app will provide personalized, contextually relevant constellation maps for each user. Individuals will be able to explore the night sky from different geographical locations by inputting latitude and longitudinal points to create visually provoking constellation maps. We hope to make stargazing more engaging and educational by personalizing the experience through various elements: color usage, map location, time zone, latitude/longitude location. Additionally, the app will be designed with a user-friendly interface to ensure accessibility with an aim to make it inclusive for people of all backgrounds and levels of astronomical knowledge. This will be achieved by using colorblind accessible palettes (avoiding bright and low-contrast colors) and providing annotations to provide readability and context for a wide range of users, including astronomy beginners."

You can explore the repository here.\n\n\nWhy did we choose this dataset?\nAs we explored various topics for a captivating visualization project using a Shiny app, we stumbled upon a fascinating reference that showcased creating city maps, which you can find here. Inspired by this, our interest evolved towards the idea of crafting a celestial map that would represent the skies above our location.\nThese datasets offer celestial visualizations based on longitude, latitude, and time parameters, granting us the ability to fashion dynamic and interactive sky maps."
